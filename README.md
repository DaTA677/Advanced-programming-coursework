# Advanced-programming-coursework

Developed as part of the Advanced programming for games coursework for Newcastle University
Code has two parts: 
1.	Generate a series based on a given equation
2.	Identify the equation based on the given series

## Folder structure

Source code along with input files are in Polynomials folder
-The main method is in the [Source.cpp](Polynomials/Source.cpp)
- [Polynomial.h](Polynomials/Polynomial.h) and [Polynomial.cpp](Polynomials/Polynomial.cpp) contain the declarations and definitions for polynomial operation
- [UI.h](Polynomials/UI.h) and [UI.cpp](Polynomials/UI.cpp) contain the menu functions and file handling functions
-A.txt, B.txt ,....,F.txt contain the output sets mentioned in the coursework.
-A-sol.txt, B-sol.txt,...., F-sol.txt contain the solutions generated by my source code
-[output.txt](Polynomials/output.txt) contains output sets mentioned in the course as well as the output sets generated by me
-[expressions-set.txt](Polynomials/expressions-set.txt) contains the expressions generated from the output sets in output.txt
